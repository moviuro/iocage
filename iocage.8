.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBiocage\fP is a system administration tool for jails designed to simplify
.TP
.B
jail management tasks.
It abstracts away the management of ZFS backed
jails running VNET or shared IP networking with optional support for
resource \fIlimits\fP.
.PP
Both shared IP based jails and VNET enabled jails are supported.
.PP
Each jail has a unique ID (UUID) automatically generated at creation time.
Using the UUID as a jail identifier means that a jail can be replicated in
.TP
.B
a distributed environment with greater flexibility.
This also eliminates
potential naming clashes on large scale deployments and helps reduce
operator error.
.PP
Partial UUID calling is supported with every operation, e.g. for
"adae47cb-01a8-11e4-aa78-3c970ea3222f" the use in the form of "adae47cb" or
just "adae" works.
.PP
In addition to partial UUID calling, jail TAG's can be used
interchangeably.
.PP
To ease jail identification a TAG field is included in \fIlist\fP mode which can
.TP
.B
be \fIset\fP to any string (hostname, label, note, etc.).
By default if unset
the TAG field contains the creation date and time stamp.
.TP
.B
Properties are stored inside ZFS custom fields.
This eliminates the need
for any configuration files and jails can be easily moved with ZFS send and
receive preserving all of their properties automatically.
.PP
Additional filesystems can be mounted from the host into the jail using an
fstab file located in ${iocroot}/jails/UUID/fstab. This file is used as a
template to generate an fstab of additional mounts for the jail at \fIruntime\fP.
The special string %jailroot% can be used in the fstab file and will be
expanded to the path of the jail's root directory at the time the jail is
started. This allows the same fstab to be usable in different jails or when
the mountpoint of the jail changes due to changing the hack88 \fIproperty\fP.
Other than the %jailroot% template, the fstab file behaves according to the
format documented in \fBfstab\fP(5).
.PP
\fBiocage\fP relies on ZFS and at least one ZFS pool must be present on the host
.TP
.B
system.
To enable all the features \fBiocage\fP supports, consider the following
optional kernel options and system reqiurements:
.RS
.TP
.B
o
FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE amd64 or higher
.TP
.B
o
bridge interfaces (bridge0,bridge1) add:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
           cloned_interfaces="bridge0 bridge1"

           to /etc/rc.conf

.fam T
.fi
.SS   SUBCOMMANDS

\fIactivate\fP [\fIzpool\fP]
.PP
.nf
.fam C
         Intended for automation tools.  The pool can be activated for iocage
         jails without requiring user input.  If the pool is not specified it is
         guessed.

.fam T
.fi
\fIfetch\fP [\fIrelease=rel\fP] [\fIftpproto=proto\fP] [\fIftphost=host\fP] [ftpdir=path]
[\fIftpfiles=\fIlist\fP\fP]
.RS
.PP
Used for downloading and updating/patching releases.
.TP
.B
\fIfetch\fP must be executed as the first \fIcommand\fP on a pristine system.
By
default \fIfetch\fP will download the most recent supported RELEASE for
.TP
.B
deployment.
If other releases are required, this can be changed by
supplying the required release \fIproperty\fP or just selecting the
appropriate RELEASE from the menu \fIlist\fP.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
           # iocage fetch release=9.2-RELEASE

.fam T
.fi
.TP
.B
\fIfetch\fP is also used to \fIupdate\fP already downloaded releases.
To \fIupdate\fP a
local release already present in \fBiocage\fP (\fBiocage\fP \fIlist\fP \fB-r\fP) run:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
           # iocage fetch release=10.2-RELEASE

.fam T
.fi
This example will apply latest patches to 10.1-RELEASE base.
.PP
Newly created jails or basejails will automatically have the latest
updates applied.
.RE
.PP
\fIcreate\fP [\fB-b\fP|\fB-c\fP|\fB-e\fP] [\fIproperty\fP=value]\.\.\.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
         Default behavior is to create a fully independent jail set by
         duplicating the release into a new dataset for the jail.

         -b       Create a so called "basejail" by cloning the release.  Every
                  time this jail is started, the base operating system will be
                  re-cloned from the release.

         -c       The created jail will be cloned from the release.

         -e       Create an empty jail which can be used for unsupported or
                  custom jails.

         By default, create will deploy a new jail based on the most recent
         supported release.  This can be changed by specifying the release
         property.

         Examples:

         Create a standard jail with the tag "www01" and install the packages
         listed in a file, using the resolv.conf of the host:

.nf
.fam C
           # iocage create tag=www01 pkglist=$HOME/my-pkgs.txt resolver="copy"

.fam T
.fi
.RS
Create a "basejail" type jail with the tag "mybasejail":
.PP
.nf
.fam C
           # iocage create -b tag=mybasejail

.fam T
.fi
.RE
\fIclone\fP [\fB-FP\fP] uuid|tag[@\fIsnapshot\fP] [\fIproperty\fP=value]\.\.\.
.PP
.nf
.fam C
         Clone the specified jail (ZFS clone).  All properties will be reset on
         the clone; defaults can be overridden by specifying properties on the
         fly.  Custom point-in-time snapshots can be used as a source for
         cloning in the form of uuid@snapshot or tag@snapshot. By default, the
         fstab of the source jail will be backed up and replaced with a blank
         fstab in the new jail.

         -F     Keep the fstab of the old jail instead of replacing it.

         -P     Set properties from the source jail instead of from the user
                defaults dataset. The template property is always initialized to
                "no" on the clone.

         Examples:

         Clone the current state of the jail tagged "www01" into a new jail with
         the tag "www02":

.nf
.fam C
           # iocage clone www01 tag=www02

.fam T
.fi
.RS
Create a jail with the tag "www03", cloning from a previously created
\fIsnapshot\fP named "fresh" taken of the jail tagged "www01" and keeping a
copy of the source jail's fstab in the \fIclone\fP:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
           # iocage clone -F www01@fresh tag=www03

.fam T
.fi
.RE
\fIdestroy\fP [\fB-f\fP] uuid|tag|ALL
.PP
.nf
.fam C
         Destroy given jail.  This is irreversible, use with caution.  If the
         jail is running destroy action will fail.

         With -f the jail will be destroyed without confirmation.

         The keyword "ALL" will destroy all jails and templates irreversibly!

.fam T
.fi
\fIreset\fP uuid|tag|ALL
.PP
.nf
.fam C
         This will reset a jail's properties back to the defaults.

         It reads from the properties set on the "default" dataset.

         The following properties retain their value when a jail is reset:

.nf
.fam C
           uuid, tag, type, jail_zfs_dataset, vnet*_mac, release, hack88,
           resolver, ip4_autostart, ip4_autoend

.fam T
.fi
.RS
You can also \fIreset\fP every jail at once by using the keyword "ALL".
.RE
.PP
\fIlist\fP [\fB-H\fP] \fB-r\fP|[\fB-btnl\fP]
.PP
.nf
.fam C
         Displays a list of all jails.  Templates are not listed by default.

         -H      Omit headers in the output.

         -r      List only the downloaded releases.  In this mode, all other
                 flags apart from -H are no-ops.

         -t      List templates and not other jails.

         -b      List only the jails that are basejails.

         -l      Long output.  Show extra information about the listed jails.

         -n      List non-iocage jails currently running in addition to the
                 iocage jail list.

         Combining the -t and -b flags shows only templates that are basejails.

.fam T

.fam T
.fi
\fIrestart\fP [\fB-H\fP] uuid|tag
.PP
.nf
.fam C
         Restart the jail identified by uuid or tag.

         This method will by default restart the jail without destroying the
         jail's networking and the jail process itself.  All processes are
         gracefully restarted inside the jail.  Soft restarting is quicker and
         more graceful than a full stop and start.

         -H      Hard restart.  Overrides the default behavior and instead
                 fully stops and starts the jail.

.fam T
.fi
\fIrcboot\fP
.PP
.nf
.fam C
         Start all jails with "boot" property set to "on".  Intended for boot
         time execution.  Jails will be started in an ordered fashion based on
         their "priority" property.  Jails with the same priority are started in
         parallel.

.fam T

         The IPv4 address for VNET and shared IP jails.

         For shared IP jails if an interface is given before the IP address, an
         alias for the address will be added to that interface, as it is with
         the interface parameter.  If the DEFAULT tag is used instead of an
         interface, the interface will be automatically assigned based upon the
         system's default interface.

         If a netmask in either dotted-quad or CIDR form is given after IP
         address, it will be used when adding the IP alias.

         Additional parameters for ifconfig(8) may optionally be supplied
         following the address.

         Multiple addresses are configured by using a comma separated list.

         If the AUTOIP4 tag is used in place of an ip-address, the IP address
         will be automatically assigned at first start of the jail.  This
         requires that the ip4_autostart and ip4_autoend variables are set on
         the 'default' property source.  If used, the IP4 address will be set to
         the first available based upon the given range and already created
         jails.

         Example:

.nf
.fam C
           # iocage set ip4_autostart="100" default
           # iocage set ip4_autoend="150" default

.fam T
.fi
.RS
This will result in the automatic IPv4 address being assigned in the
.TP
.B
base range of the default network interface.
I.E. if the local default
NIC is \fIset\fP to 192.168.0.XXX, then the new address will be
192.168.0.[100-150]

For VNET jails the interface will be configured with the IP addresses
listed.

.SH RESOURCE LIMITS
Resource \fIlimits\fP (except cpuset and rlimits) use the following value
field formatting in the \fIproperty\fP: limit:action.
.PP
Limit defines how much of the resource a process can use before the
defined action triggers.
.PP
Action defines what will happen when a process exceeds the allowed
amount.
.PP
Valid actions are:
.RS
.TP
.B
deny
deny the allocation; not supported for cpu and
wallclock
.TP
.B
log
log a warning to the \fIconsole\fP
.TP

.SH HINTS
\fBiocage\fP marks a ZFS pool in a \fIproperty\fP on the pool's root-level dataset and
identifies the active pool for use based on this \fIproperty\fP.
.PP
If using VNET don't forget to add the node's physical NIC into one
.TP
.B
of the bridges if you need an outside connection.
Also read \fBbridge\fP(4)
to see how traffic is handled if you are not familiar with this concept
(in a nutshell: bridge behaves like a network switch).
.TP
.B
PF firewall is not supported inside VNET jails as of July 2014.
PF can be
.TP
.B
enabled for the host however.
IPFW is fully supported inside a VNET jail.
.PP
Property validation is not handled by \fBiocage\fP (to keep it simple) so please
make sure your \fIproperty\fP values are supported before configuring any
properties.
.TP
.B
The actual jail name in the \fBjls\fP(8) output is \fIset\fP to ioc-UUID.
This is a
required workaround as jails will refuse to \fIstart\fP with \fBjail\fP(8) when name
starts with a "0".
.PP
To prevent dmesg leak inside jails apply the following sysctl:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       security.bsd.unprivileged_read_msgbuf=0

.fam T
.fi
If using VNET consider applying these sysctl's as well:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
       net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
       net.link.bridge.pfil_onlyip=0
       net.link.bridge.pfil_bridge=0
       net.link.bridge.pfil_member=0
