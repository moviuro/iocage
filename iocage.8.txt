DESCRIPTION
     iocage is a system administration tool for jails designed to simplify
     jail management tasks.  It abstracts away the management of ZFS backed
     jails running VNET or shared IP networking with optional support for
     resource limits.

     Both shared IP based jails and VNET enabled jails are supported.

     Each jail has a unique ID (UUID) automatically generated at creation time.
     Using the UUID as a jail identifier means that a jail can be replicated in
     a distributed environment with greater flexibility.  This also eliminates
     potential naming clashes on large scale deployments and helps reduce
     operator error.

     Partial UUID calling is supported with every operation, e.g. for
     "adae47cb-01a8-11e4-aa78-3c970ea3222f" the use in the form of "adae47cb" or
     just "adae" works.

     In addition to partial UUID calling, jail TAG's can be used
     interchangeably.

     To ease jail identification a TAG field is included in list mode which can
     be set to any string (hostname, label, note, etc.).  By default if unset
     the TAG field contains the creation date and time stamp.

     Properties are stored inside ZFS custom fields.  This eliminates the need
     for any configuration files and jails can be easily moved with ZFS send and
     receive preserving all of their properties automatically.

     Additional filesystems can be mounted from the host into the jail using an
     fstab file located in ${iocroot}/jails/UUID/fstab. This file is used as a
     template to generate an fstab of additional mounts for the jail at runtime.
     The special string %jailroot% can be used in the fstab file and will be
     expanded to the path of the jail's root directory at the time the jail is
     started. This allows the same fstab to be usable in different jails or when
     the mountpoint of the jail changes due to changing the hack88 property.
     Other than the %jailroot% template, the fstab file behaves according to the
     format documented in fstab(5).

     iocage relies on ZFS and at least one ZFS pool must be present on the host
     system.  To enable all the features iocage supports, consider the following
     optional kernel options and system reqiurements:

       o   FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE amd64 or higher
       o   bridge interfaces (bridge0,bridge1) add:

           cloned_interfaces="bridge0 bridge1"

           to /etc/rc.conf

       o   Kernel compiled with:

           options         VIMAGE
           options         RACCT
           options         RCTL

   SUBCOMMANDS

     activate [zpool]

         Intended for automation tools.  The pool can be activated for iocage
         jails without requiring user input.  If the pool is not specified it is
         guessed.

     fetch [release=rel] [ftpproto=proto] [ftphost=host] [ftpdir=path]
           [ftpfiles=list]

         Used for downloading and updating/patching releases.

         fetch must be executed as the first command on a pristine system.  By
         default fetch will download the most recent supported RELEASE for
         deployment.  If other releases are required, this can be changed by
         supplying the required release property or just selecting the
         appropriate RELEASE from the menu list.

         Example:

           # iocage fetch release=9.2-RELEASE

         fetch is also used to update already downloaded releases.  To update a
         local release already present in iocage (iocage list -r) run:

           # iocage fetch release=10.2-RELEASE

         This example will apply latest patches to 10.1-RELEASE base.

         Newly created jails or basejails will automatically have the latest
         updates applied.

     create [-b|-c|-e] [property=value]...

         Default behavior is to create a fully independent jail set by
         duplicating the release into a new dataset for the jail.

         -b       Create a so called "basejail" by cloning the release.  Every
                  time this jail is started, the base operating system will be
                  re-cloned from the release.

         -c       The created jail will be cloned from the release.

         -e       Create an empty jail which can be used for unsupported or
                  custom jails.

         By default, create will deploy a new jail based on the most recent
         supported release.  This can be changed by specifying the release
         property.

         Examples:

         Create a standard jail with the tag "www01" and install the packages
         listed in a file, using the resolv.conf of the host:

           # iocage create tag=www01 pkglist=$HOME/my-pkgs.txt resolver="copy"

         Create a "basejail" type jail with the tag "mybasejail":

           # iocage create -b tag=mybasejail

     clone [-FP] uuid|tag[@snapshot] [property=value]...

         Clone the specified jail (ZFS clone).  All properties will be reset on
         the clone; defaults can be overridden by specifying properties on the
         fly.  Custom point-in-time snapshots can be used as a source for
         cloning in the form of uuid@snapshot or tag@snapshot. By default, the
         fstab of the source jail will be backed up and replaced with a blank
         fstab in the new jail.

         -F     Keep the fstab of the old jail instead of replacing it.

         -P     Set properties from the source jail instead of from the user
                defaults dataset. The template property is always initialized to
                "no" on the clone.

         Examples:

         Clone the current state of the jail tagged "www01" into a new jail with
         the tag "www02":

           # iocage clone www01 tag=www02

         Create a jail with the tag "www03", cloning from a previously created
         snapshot named "fresh" taken of the jail tagged "www01" and keeping a
         copy of the source jail's fstab in the clone:

           # iocage clone -F www01@fresh tag=www03

     destroy [-f] uuid|tag|ALL

         Destroy given jail.  This is irreversible, use with caution.  If the
         jail is running destroy action will fail.

         With -f the jail will be destroyed without confirmation.

         The keyword "ALL" will destroy all jails and templates irreversibly!

     reset uuid|tag|ALL

         This will reset a jail's properties back to the defaults.

         It reads from the properties set on the "default" dataset.

         The following properties retain their value when a jail is reset:

           uuid, tag, type, jail_zfs_dataset, vnet*_mac, release, hack88,
           resolver, ip4_autostart, ip4_autoend

         You can also reset every jail at once by using the keyword "ALL".

     list [-H] -r|[-btnl]

         Displays a list of all jails.  Templates are not listed by default.

         -H      Omit headers in the output.

         -r      List only the downloaded releases.  In this mode, all other
                 flags apart from -H are no-ops.

         -t      List templates and not other jails.

         -b      List only the jails that are basejails.

         -l      Long output.  Show extra information about the listed jails.

         -n      List non-iocage jails currently running in addition to the
                 iocage jail list.

         Combining the -t and -b flags shows only templates that are basejails.

     status [-H] [uuid|tag]

         Show the whether a jail is "up" or "down".  If no jail is specified,
         the status of all jails is output.

         -H      Suppress header.  When no jail is specified, a header is
                 normally show unless this option is used.  No-op when a jail is
                 specified.

     df [-p]

         List disk space related information.  If -p is specified, the output
         displays raw values so as to be machine parseable, and tags are not
         shown.

         Listed fields:

         CRT - compression ratio
         RES - reserved space
         QTA - disk quota
         USE - used space
         AVA - available space

     start uuid|tag

         Start the jail identified by uuid or tag.

     stop uuid|tag

         Stop the jail identified by uuid or tag.

     restart [-H] uuid|tag

         Restart the jail identified by uuid or tag.

         This method will by default restart the jail without destroying the
         jail's networking and the jail process itself.  All processes are
         gracefully restarted inside the jail.  Soft restarting is quicker and
         more graceful than a full stop and start.

         -H      Hard restart.  Overrides the default behavior and instead
                 fully stops and starts the jail.

     rcboot

         Start all jails with "boot" property set to "on".  Intended for boot
         time execution.  Jails will be started in an ordered fashion based on
         their "priority" property.  Jails with the same priority are started in
         parallel.

     rcshutdown

         Stop all jails with "boot" property set to "on".  Intended for full
         host shutdown.  Jails will be stopped in an ordered fashion based on
         their "priority" property.  Jails with the same priority are started in
         parallel.

     console uuid|tag

         Console access drops the user to a root shell running in the jail.

     exec [-u username|-U username] uuid|tag|ALL command [arg]...

         Execute command inside the jail.  This is simply an iocage UUID/tag
         wrapper for jexec(8).

     chroot uuid|tag [command [args]...]

         Chroot into jail, without actually starting the jail itself.  Useful
         for initial setup (set root password, configure networking).  You can
         specify a command just like with the normal system chroot tool.

     show property

         Show the given property for all jails and templates.  This is useful
         for comparing settings/properties across all jails.

         Example:

         To get the last successfull start time for all jails:

           # iocage show last_started

     get property[,property[,...]]|all [uuid|tag|ALL] [uuid|tag [...]]

         Get the named property or if "all" keyword is specified dump all
         properties known to iocage.  If no jail is specified or the keyword
         "ALL" is given as the jail, the property is listed for all jails.

         -H     Suppress headers

         Examples:

           To display whether resource limits are enforced for a jail:

           # iocage get rlimits UUID|TAG

           To display all attributed IPv4 addresses:

           # iocage get ip4_addr ALL
           # iocage get ip4_addr

           To display all information about a jail:

           # iocage get all UUID|TAG

     set property=value[,property=value[,...]] uuid|tag [uuid|tag [...]]

         Set a property to value.

     cap uuid|tag

         Reapply resource limits on a jail while it is running.

     limits [uuid|tag]

         Display active resource limits for a jail or all jails.  With no jail
         specified, display all limits active for all jails.

     uncap uuid|tag

         Release all resource limits.  This command can disable limits on
         running jails on the fly.

     inuse [uuid|tag]

         Display consumed resources for a jail.  Without a specified jail, dump
         all resources for all running jails in a comma delimited form.

     snapshot uuid|tag[@snapshot]

         Create a ZFS snapshot for jail.  If no snapshot name is specified, a
         name based on the current date and time is generated.

     snaplist uuid|tag

         List all snapshots belonging to jail.

         Listed fields:

         NAME    - snapshot name
         CREATED - creation time
         RSIZE   - referenced size
         USED    - used space

     snapremove uuid|tag@snapshot|ALL

         Destroy the specified jail snapshot.  If the keyword ALL is specified,
         all snapshots will be destroyed for the jail.

     rollback uuid|tag@snapshot

         Rollback to an existing snapshot.  Any intermediate snapshots will be
         destroyed.  For more information on this functionality please read
         zfs(8).

     promote uuid|tag

         Promote a cloned jail to a fully independent copy.  For more details
         please read zfs(8).

     runtime uuid|tag

         Show runtime configuration of a jail.  Useful for debugging.

     update uuid|tag

         Update jail to latest patch level.  A back-out snapshot is created to
         allow safe update/rollback.

     upgrade uuid|tag [release=rel]

         By default this will upgrade a jail to match the most current supported
         release, unless another otherwise specified with the "release"
         property.

         Please note: Upgrading basejails is done by setting the jail's
         "release" property to the required new release:

         iocage set release=10.1-RELEASE uuid|tag

         For this the release must be locally available.  The basejail will
         re-clone its filesystems from the new release either by issuing the
         upgrade command or at next jail start.

     defaults

         Display all defaults set in iocage itself.

     version|--version

         List version number.

     help

         List quick help.

PROPERTIES
     For more information on properties please check the relevant man page which
     is noted under each property in the form of "Source: manpage".  Source
     "local" marks iocage specific properties.

     pkglist=none | path-to-file
         A text file containing one package per line.  These will be auto-
         installed when a jail is created.  Works only in combination with the
         create subcommand.

         Note: A working resolver is required for this feature. The default
         resolver setting creates the jail without a resolver configured. Set
         resolver in the user defaults or on the command line for this to work.

         Default: none
         Source: local

     vnet=on | off
         This controls whether to start the jail with VNET or a shared IP
         configuration.  Default is to auto-guess from a sysctl.  If you don't
         need a fully-virtualized per-jail network stack, set it to off.

         Default: auto-guess
         Source: local

     ip4_addr="interface|ip-address/netmask param ..."

         The IPv4 address for VNET and shared IP jails.

         For shared IP jails if an interface is given before the IP address, an
         alias for the address will be added to that interface, as it is with
         the interface parameter.  If the DEFAULT tag is used instead of an
         interface, the interface will be automatically assigned based upon the
         system's default interface.

         If a netmask in either dotted-quad or CIDR form is given after IP
         address, it will be used when adding the IP alias.

         Additional parameters for ifconfig(8) may optionally be supplied
         following the address.

         Multiple addresses are configured by using a comma separated list.

         If the AUTOIP4 tag is used in place of an ip-address, the IP address
         will be automatically assigned at first start of the jail.  This
         requires that the ip4_autostart and ip4_autoend variables are set on
         the 'default' property source.  If used, the IP4 address will be set to
         the first available based upon the given range and already created
         jails.

         Example:

           # iocage set ip4_autostart="100" default
           # iocage set ip4_autoend="150" default

         This will result in the automatic IPv4 address being assigned in the
         base range of the default network interface.  I.E. if the local default
         NIC is set to 192.168.0.XXX, then the new address will be
         192.168.0.[100-150]

         For VNET jails the interface will be configured with the IP addresses
         listed.

         Example:

           # iocage set ip4_addr="vnet0|192.168.0.10/24,vnet1|10.1.1.10/24"

         This would configure interfaces vnet0 and vnet1 in a VNET jail.  In
         this case no network configuration is necessary in the jail's rc.conf
         file.

         Default: none
         Source: jail(8)

     ip4_saddrsel=1 | 0
         Only takes effect when vnet=off.
         A boolean option to change the formerly mentioned behaviour and disable
         IPv4 source address selection for the prison in favour of the primary
         IPv4 address of the jail.  Source address selection is enabled by
         default for all jails, and the ip4_nosaddrsel settting of a parent jail
         is not inherited for any child jails.

         Default: 1
         Source: jail(8)

     ip4=new | disable | inherit
         Only takes effect when vnet=off.
         Control the availability of IPv4 addresses.  Possible values are
         "inherit" to allow unrestricted access to all system addresses, "new"
         to restrict addresses via ip4.addr above, and "disable" to stop the
         jail from using IPv4 entirely.  Setting the ip4.addr parameter implies
         a value of "new".

         Default: new
         Source: jail(8)

     defaultrouter=none | ipaddress
         Setting this property to anything other than none will try to
         configure a default route inside a VNET jail.

         Default: none
         Source: route(8)

     defaultrouter6=none | ip6address
         Setting this property to anything other than none will try to
         configure a default IPv6 route inside a VNET jail.

         Default: none
         Source: route(8)

     resolver=none | copy | nameserver IP;nameserver IP;search domain.local
         Sets the jail's resolver (resolv.conf).

         If the resolver is set to "none", (default) the jail's resolv.conf will
         not be touched by iocage.  A resolv.conf file must be manually created
         in the jail and managed by the administrator.

         If the resolver is set to "copy", the jail will inherit the host's
         resolv.conf file.  When the jail starts, /etc/resolv.conf is copied
         into the jail from the host, replacing the file in the jail if it
         already exists.

         If the resolver is set to something other than "none" or "copy" then
         the string is transformed into a resolv.conf file for the jail at start
         time, replacing the file in the jail if it already exists.  Fields must
         be ; delimited, which are translated to newlines in the resulting file.

         Default: none
         Source: resolver(5)

     ip6_addr, ip6_saddrsel, ip6
         A set of IPv6 options for the prison, the counterparts to ip4_addr,
         ip4_saddrsel and ip4 above.

         Source: jail(8)

     interfaces=vnet0:bridge0,vnet1:bridge1 | vnet0:bridge0
         By default there are two interfaces specified with their bridge
         association.  Up to four interfaces are supported.  Interface
         configurations are separated by commas.  Format is interface:bridge,
         where left value is the virtual VNET interface name, right value is the
         bridge name where the virtual interface should be attached.

         Default: vnet0:bridge0,vnet1:bridge1
         Source: local

     host_hostname=UUID
         The hostname of the jail.

         Default: UUID
         Source: jail(8)

     exec_fib=0 | 1 ...
         The FIB (routing table) to set when running commands inside the jail.

         Default: 0
         Source: jail(8)

     devfs_ruleset=4 | 0 ...
         The number of the devfs ruleset that is enforced for mounting devfs in
         this jail.  A value of zero (default) means no ruleset is enforced.
         Descendant jails inherit the parent jail's devfs ruleset enforcement.
         Mounting devfs inside a jail is possible only if the allow_mount and
         allow_mount_devfs permissions are effective and enforce_statfs is set
         to a value lower than 2.  Devfs rules and rulesets cannot be viewed or
         modified from inside a jail.

         Note: It is important that only appropriate device nodes in devfs be
         exposed to a jail; access to disk devices in the jail may permit
         processes in the jail to bypass the jail sandboxing by modifying files
         outside of the jail.  See devfs(8) for information on how to use devfs
         rules to limit access to entries in the per-jail devfs.  A simple devfs
         ruleset for jails is available as ruleset #4 in
         /etc/defaults/devfs.rules

         Default: 4
         Source: jail(8)

     mount_devfs=1 | 0
         Mount a devfs(5) filesystem on the chrooted /dev directory, and apply
         the ruleset in the devfs_ruleset parameter (or a default of ruleset 4:
         devfsrules_jail) to restrict the devices visible inside the jail.

         Default: 1
         Source: jail(8)

     exec_start="/bin/sh /etc/rc"
         Command(s) to run in the prison environment when a jail is created.

         Default: /bin/sh /etc/rc
         Source: jail(8)

     exec_stop="/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown"
         Command(s) to run in the prison environment before a jail is removed,
         and after any exec_prestop commands have completed.

         Default: /bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown
         Source: jail(8)

     exec_prestart="/usr/bin/true"
         Command(s) to run in the system environment before a jail is started.

         Default: /usr/bin/true
         Source: jail(8)

     exec_poststart="/usr/bin/true"
         Command(s) to run in the system environment after a jail is started,
         and after any exec_start commands have completed.

         Default: /usr/bin/true
         Source: jail(8)

     exec_clean=1 | 0
         Run commands in a clean environment.  The environment is discarded
         except for HOME, SHELL, TERM and USER.  HOME and SHELL are set to the
         target login's default values.  USER is set to the target login.  TERM
         is imported from the current environment.  The environment variables
         from the login class capability database for the target login are also
         set.

         Default: 1
         Source: jail(8)

     exec_timeout=60 | 30 ...
         The maximum amount of time to wait for a command to complete.  If a
         command is still running after this many seconds have passed, the jail
         will be terminated.

         Default: 60
         Source: jail(8)

     stop_timeout=30 | 60 ...
         The maximum amount of time to wait for a jail's processes to exit after
         sending them a SIGTERM signal (which happens after the exec_stop
         commands have completed).  After this many seconds have passed, the
         jail will be removed, which will kill any remaining processes.  If this
         is set to zero, no SIGTERM is sent and the prison is immediately
         removed.

         Default: 30
         Source: jail(8)

     exec_jail_user=root
         The user to run commands as, when running in the jail environment.

         Default: root
         Source:  jail(8)

     exec_system_jail_user=0 | 1
         This boolean option looks for the exec_jail_user in the system
         passwd(5) file, instead of in the jail's file.

         Default: 0
         Source: jail(8)

     exec_system_user=root
         The user to run commands as, when running in the system environment.
         The default is to run the commands as the current user.

         Default: root
         Source: jail(8)

     mount_fdescfs=1 | 0
         Mount a fdescfs(5) filesystem in the jail's /dev/fd directory.
         Note: This is not supported on FreeBSD 9.3.

         Default: 1
         Source: jail(8)

     mount_procfs=0 | 1
         Mount a procfs(5) filesystem in the jail's /dev/proc directory.

         Default: 0
         Source: local

     enforce_statfs=2 | 1 | 0
         This determines which information processes in a jail are able to get
         about mount points.  It affects the behaviour of the following
         syscalls: statfs(2), fstatfs(2), getfsstat(2) and fhstatfs(2) (as well
         as similar compatibility syscalls).  When set to 0, all mount points
         are available without any restrictions.  When set to 1, only mount
         points below the jail's chroot directory are visible.  In addition to
         that, the path to the jail's chroot directory is removed from the front
         of their pathnames.  When set to 2 (default), above syscalls can
         operate only on a mount-point where the jail's chroot directory is
         located.

         Default: 2
         Source: jail(8)

     children_max=0 | ...
         The number of child jails allowed to be created by this jail (or by
         other jails under this jail).  This limit is zero by default,
         indicating the jail is not allowed to create child jails.  See the
         Hierarchical Jails section for more information in jail(8).

         Default: 0
         Source: jail(8)

     login_flags="-f root"
         Supply these flags to login when logging in to jails with the console
         function.

         Default: -f root
         Source: login(1)

     jail_zfs=on | off
         Enables automatic ZFS jailing inside the jail.  Assigned ZFS dataset
         will be fully controlled by the jail.
         Note: Setting this to "on" automatically enables allow_mount=1
         enforce_statfs=1 and allow_mount_zfs=1! These are dependent options
         required for ZFS management inside a jail.

         Default: off
         Source: local

     jail_zfs_dataset=DEFAULT/iocage/jails/UUID/data | zfs_filesystem
         This is the dataset to be jailed and fully handed over to a jail.
         Takes the full ZFS filesystem name including the pool name. "DEFAULT"
         may be used as a keyword to represent the default pool iocage uses.
         Note: only valid if jail_zfs=on.  By default the mountpoint is set to
         none, to mount this dataset set its mountpoint inside the jail i.e.
         "zfs set mountpoint=/data full-dataset-name" and issue "mount -a".

         Default: DEFAULT/iocage/jails/UUID/data
         Source: local

     securelevel=3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | -1
         The value of the jail's kern.securelevel sysctl.  A jail never has a
         lower securelevel than the default system, but by setting this
         parameter it may have a higher one.  If the system securelevel is
         changed, any jail securelevels will be at least as secure.

         Default: 2
         Source: jail(8)

     allow_set_hostname=1 | 0
         The jail's hostname may be changed via hostname(1) or sethostname(3).

         Default: 1
         Source: jail(8)

     allow_sysvipc=0 | 1
         A process within the jail has access to System V IPC primitives.  In
         the current jail implementation, System V primitives share a single
         namespace across the host and jail environments, meaning that processes
         within a jail would be able to communicate with (and potentially
         interfere with) processes outside of the jail, and in other jails.

         Default: 0
         Source: jail(8)

     allow_raw_sockets=0 | 1
         The prison root is allowed to create raw sockets.  Setting this
         parameter allows utilities like ping(8) and traceroute(8) to operate
         inside the prison.  If this is set, the source IP addresses are
         enforced to comply with the IP address bound to the jail, regardless of
         whether or not the IP_HDRINCL flag has been set on the socket.

         Since raw sockets can be used to configure and interact with various
         network subsystems, extra caution should be used where privileged
         access to jails is given out to untrusted parties.

         Default: 0
         Source: jail(8)

     allow_chflags=0 | 1
         Normally, privileged users inside a jail are treated as unprivileged by
         chflags(2).  When this parameter is set, such users are treated as
         privileged, and may manipulate system file flags subject to the usual
         constraints on kern.securelevel.

         Default: 0
         Source: jail(8)

     allow_mount=0 | 1
         Privileged users inside the jail will be able to mount and unmount file
         system types marked as jail-friendly.  The lsvfs(1) command can be used
         to find file system types available for mount from within a jail.  This
         permission is effective only if enforce_statfs is set to a value lower
         than 2.

         Default: 0
         Source: jail(8)

     allow_mount_devfs=0 | 1
         Privileged users inside the jail will be able to mount and unmount the
         devfs file system.  This permission is effective only together with
         allow.mount and if enforce_statfs is set to a value lower than 2.
         Please consider restricting the devfs ruleset with the devfs_ruleset
         option.

         Default: 0
         Source: jail(8)

     allow_mount_nullfs=0 | 1
         Privileged users inside the jail will be able to mount and unmount the
         nullfs file system.  This permission is effective only together with
         allow_mount and if enforce_statfs is set to a value lower than 2.

         Default: 0
         Source: jail(8)

     allow_mount_procfs=0 | 1
         Privileged users inside the jail will be able to mount and unmount the
         procfs file system.  This permission is effective only together with
         allow.mount and if enforce_statfs is set to a value lower than 2.

         Default: 0
         Source: jail(8)

     allow_mount_tmpfs=0 | 1
         Privileged users inside the jail will be able to mount and unmount the
         tmpfs file system.  This permission is effective only together with
         allow.mount and if enforce_statfs is set to a value lower than 2.
         Note: This is not supported on FreeBSD 9.3.

         Default: 0
         Source: jail(8)

     allow_mount_zfs=0 | 1
         Privileged users inside the jail will be able to mount and unmount the
         ZFS file system.  This permission is effective only together with
         allow.mount and if enforce_statfs is set to a value lower than 2.  See
         zfs(8) for information on how to configure the ZFS filesystem to
         operate from within a jail.

         Default: 0
         Source: jail(8)

     allow_quotas=0 | 1
         The jail root may administer quotas on the jail's filesystem(s).  This
         includes filesystems that the jail may share with other jails or with
         non-jailed parts of the system.

         Default: 0
         Source: jail(8)

     allow_socket_af=0 | 1
         Sockets within a jail are normally restricted to IPv4, IPv6, local
         (UNIX), and route.  This allows access to other protocol stacks that
         have not had jail functionality added to them.

         Default: 0

     tag="any string"
         Custom string for aliasing jails.

         Default: date@time
         Source: local

     template=yes | no
         This property controls whether the jail is a template.  Templates are
         not started by iocage.  Set to yes if you intend to convert jail into
         template.

         (See EXAMPLES section)

         Default: no
         Source: local

     boot=on | off
         If set to "on" jail will be auto-started at boot time (rcboot
         subcommand) and stopped at shutdown time (rcshutdown subcommand).
         Jails will be started and stopped based on their priority value.

         Default: off

         Default: root
         Source: local

     priority=99 | 50 ...
         Start priority at boot time, smaller value means higher priority.
         Also, for shutdown the order will be reversed.

         Default: 99

     last_started
         Last successful start time.  Auto set every time jail starts.

     hostid=UUID
         The UUID of the host node.  Jails won't start if this property differs
         from the actual UUID of the host node.  This is to safeguard jails from
         being started on different nodes in case they are periodically
         replicated across.

         Default: UUID of the host (taken from /etc/hostid)
         Source: local

     release=10.2-RELEASE | 9.3-RELEASE
         The RELEASE used at creation time.  Can be set to any string if needed.

         Default: the most recent supported RELEASE
         Source: local

     compression=on | off | lzjb | gzip | gzip-N | zle | lz4
         Controls the compression algorithm used for this dataset.  The lzjb
         compression algorithm is optimized for performance while providing
         decent data compression.  Setting compression to on uses the lzjb
         compression algorithm.  The gzip compression algorithm uses the same
         compression as the gzip(1) command.  Specify the gzip level by using
         the value gzip-N where N is an integer from 1 (fastest) to 9 (best
         compression ratio).  Currently, gzip is equivalent to gzip-6 (which
         is also the default for gzip(1)).  The zle compression algorithm
         compresses runs of zeros.

         The lz4 compression algorithm is a high-performance replacement for the
         lzjb algorithm.  It features significantly faster compression and
         decompression, as well as a moderately higher compression ratio than
         lzjb, but can only be used on pools with the lz4_compress feature set
         to enabled.  See zpool-features(7) for details on ZFS feature flags and
         the lz4_compress feature.

         This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name
         compress.  Changing this property affects only newly-written data.

         Default: lz4
         Source: zfs(8)

     origin
         This is only set for clones.  Read-only.
         For cloned file systems or volumes, the snapshot from which the clone
         was created.  See also the clones property.

         Default: -

     quota=15G | 50G | ...
         Quota for jail.
         Limits the amount of space a dataset and its descendents can consume.
         This property enforces a hard limit on the amount of space used.  This
         includes all space consumed by descendents, including file systems and
         snapshots.  Setting a quota on a descendent of a dataset that already
         has a quota does not override the ancestor's quota, but rather imposes
         an additional limit.

         Default: none
         Source: zfs(8)

     mountpoint
         Path for the jail's root filesystem.  Read-only.

         Source: zfs(8)

     compressratio
         Compression ratio.  Read-only.
         For non-snapshots, the compression ratio achieved for the used space of
         this dataset, expressed as a multiplier.  The used property includes
         descendant datasets, and, for clones, does not include the space shared
         with the origin snapshot.

         Source: zfs(8)

     available
         Available space in jail's dataset.
         The amount of space available to the dataset and all its children,
         assuming that there is no other activity in the pool.  Because space is
         shared within a pool, availability can be limited by any number of
         factors, including physical pool size, quotas, reservations, or other
         datasets within the pool.

         Source: zfs(8)

     used
         Used space by jail.  Read-only.
         The amount of space consumed by this dataset and all its descendents.
         This is the value that is checked against this dataset's quota and
         reservation.  The space used does not include this dataset's
         reservation, but does take into account the reservations of any
         descendent datasets.  The amount of space that a dataset consumes from
         its parent, as well as the amount of space that are freed if this
         dataset is recursively destroyed, is the greater of its space used and
         its reservation.

         When snapshots (see the "Snapshots" section) are created, their space
         is initially shared between the snapshot and the file system, and
         possibly with previous snapshots.  As the file system changes, space
         that was previously shared becomes unique to the snapshot, and counted
         in the snapshot's space used.  Additionally, deleting snapshots can
         increase the amount of space unique to (and used by) other snapshots.

         The amount of space used, available, or referenced does not take into
         account pending changes.  Pending changes are generally accounted for
         within a few seconds.  Committing a change to a disk using fsync(2) or
         O_SYNC does not necessarily guarantee that the space usage information
         is updated immediately.

     dedup=on | off | verify | sha256[,verify]
         Deduplication for jail.
         Configures deduplication for a dataset.  The default value is off.
         The default deduplication checksum is sha256 (this may change in the
         future).  When dedup is enabled, the checksum defined here overrides
         the checksum property.  Setting the value to verify has the same
         effect as the setting sha256,verify.

         If set to verify, ZFS will do a byte-to-byte comparsion in case of
         two blocks having the same signature to make sure the block contents
         are identical.

         Default: off
         Source: zfs(8)

     reservation=size | none
         Reserved space for jail.
         The minimum amount of space guaranteed to a dataset and its
         descendents.  When the amount of space used is below this value, the
         dataset is treated as if it were taking up the amount of space
         specified by its reservation.  Reservations are accounted for in the
         parent datasets' space used, and count against the parent datasets'
         quotas and reservations.

         Source: cpuset(1)

RESOURCE LIMITS
     Resource limits (except cpuset and rlimits) use the following value
     field formatting in the property: limit:action.

     Limit defines how much of the resource a process can use before the
     defined action triggers.

     Action defines what will happen when a process exceeds the allowed
     amount.

     Valid actions are:
           deny    deny the allocation; not supported for cpu and
                   wallclock
           log     log a warning to the console
           devctl  send notification to devd(8)
           sig*    e.g. sigterm; send a signal to the offending
                   process

     To better understand what this means please read rctl(8)
     before enabling any limits.

     The following resource limits are supported:

     memoryuse=limit:action | off

       Limits the resident set size (DRAM).

EXAMPLES
     Set up iocage from scratch:

       # iocage fetch

     Create first jail:

       # iocage create tag=myjail

     List jails:

       # iocage list

     Start jail:

       # iocage start UUID

     Turn on resource limits and apply them:

       # iocage set rlimits=on UUID
       # iocage cap UUID

     Display resource usage:

       # iocage inuse UUID

     Convert jail into template:

       # iocage set template=yes UUID

     List templates:

       # iocage list -t

     Clone jail from template:

       # iocage clone UUID-of-template tag=myjail

     Get the last successful start time for all jails:

       # iocage show last_started

HINTS
     iocage marks a ZFS pool in a property on the pool's root-level dataset and
     identifies the active pool for use based on this property.

     If using VNET don't forget to add the node's physical NIC into one
     of the bridges if you need an outside connection.  Also read bridge(4)
     to see how traffic is handled if you are not familiar with this concept
     (in a nutshell: bridge behaves like a network switch).

     PF firewall is not supported inside VNET jails as of July 2014.  PF can be
     enabled for the host however.  IPFW is fully supported inside a VNET jail.

     Property validation is not handled by iocage (to keep it simple) so please
     make sure your property values are supported before configuring any
     properties.

     The actual jail name in the jls(8) output is set to ioc-UUID.  This is a
     required workaround as jails will refuse to start with jail(8) when name
     starts with a "0".

     To prevent dmesg leak inside jails apply the following sysctl:

       security.bsd.unprivileged_read_msgbuf=0

     If using VNET consider applying these sysctl's as well:

       net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
       net.link.bridge.pfil_onlyip=0
       net.link.bridge.pfil_bridge=0
       net.link.bridge.pfil_member=0
